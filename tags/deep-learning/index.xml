      <description>There are a lot of fantastic old movies for people to appreciate. However, the out-of-date filming technology and the black-and-white presentation make them less enjoyable. We want to make classic film works adorable again by endowing the old black-and-white version with vibrant colors, and even more interesting, parallel it with a cartoonized version. Our goal is to re-energize those old movies through deep learning techniques: Apply colorization on videos by convolutional networks, and animate it with different cartoon styles through GANs.</description>
